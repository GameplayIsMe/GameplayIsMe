Hello there,

My name is Jericho and I'm a Game Development student here at Full Sail.

If I were to change degrees it would most probably be Computer Science, either of these two degrees will prepare me for the responsibilities I may have in my career.

My love for Game Development came after watching Grandma's Boy(2006), before that I didn't know it was possible.

In my free time, I choose to either read about current events in the world, enjoy a video game, or work on one of my many projects for fun.

Connecting with peers and working on a project together is a major goal of mine, even if it's something small, I would love to experience dynamic teamwork in Game Development.
